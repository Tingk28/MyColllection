            <h1>Graduate Program (Accounting Information Group)</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Founding Rationales</h2>
            <p>In order to implement both theories and practices of Accounting profession, the Graduate Institute of Accounting emphasizes the use of information technology (IT). 
                This would provide the students with working capability as well as competitiveness necessary in their future careers. The recent IT boom enables accounting information
                 system to substitute for traditional accountancy. It also accelerates the transfer of information in financial accounting. Although the information technology may enhance
                  effectiveness, the question is how we can computerize the accounting system to meet the financial demand and whether the accounting personnel have enough knowledge and 
                  skill to carry out accounting and the computerized financial system. Graduates with knowledge of information system and in-depth understanding of accounting domains were
                   so demanded amongst employers of the accounting industry that, in 1999, the Graduate Institute of Accounting initiated an information-oriented program. It enables students 
                   to learn computational technology applied to all aspects of accounting practice, which would definitely complement their accounting skills and turn them into versatile graduates.</p>
            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>In the era of Taiwan vs. China and global competition, pure accounting skill alone is insufficient. The combination of information technology and accountancy has attracted a gradual
                 attention among the academics. The industry has been trying to nurture this set of skills. In line with this notion, National Cheng Kung University has moved towards the same direction
                  by establishing a major that covers both specialization in IT and accounting. Therefore, students with IT background are allowed to pursue accounting knowledge as well as financial 
                  studies. This program would nurture the potential of the students to become young, well rounded individuals in the commercial world. They will be well-equipped with IT skills as well 
                  as financial and accounting management and decision-making skills.</p>
            <h2>7 teaching characteristics</h2>
